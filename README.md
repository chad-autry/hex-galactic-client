# hexagonal-space-client
This is JavaScript client application for my game platform Hexagonal Space. The primary game is HexGalactic, a massively multiplayer persistent online programming game. However, Hexagonal Space can also host map creators, code simulators, and more traditional direct player control tactics games using HexGalactic rules or other rule sets.

I do akcnowledge that it is a public GitHub project. You can freely fork (but not edit for public use), clone, and view the project. You could even privately host a version and no one would know. I wanted to elaborate on the reasoning behind making an unlicensed public project.

1. This is a JavaSCript application which runs in the browser and can be trivially viewed when hosted
    * I don't believe in security by obscurity. The code is compressed when built only to save on size.
2. Private repos cost money. Given that the source can be seen when hosted anyways that money can be used better elsewhere
3. The client facing project is a great one to use the public issue tracker for the game as a whole
4. Once copyright assignment is setup, I could accept pull requests for any enhancements or formatting issues fans might wish to assist with

## Dependencies
Please see the package.json file for the dependencies used. Pretty much everything technical (anything not directly game related) should be an open source third party component. You should be able to replicate any programming architecture, technique, or effect you see without violating the project's copyright.
